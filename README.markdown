vimscriptdev.info nanoc
================================================================================
Okay, phase two, or ten or whatever it is now. [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/)
seems to be a much better fit for what I'd like to do here. Give it a try and let
me know what you think.


TODO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Random list of things to do.

__Essential__

* move nanoc setup to existing vsdi repo
* switch vimscriptdev.info domain to point at github pages repo
* .rvmrc
* Gemfile
* document pygments modifications
  * ideally fix nanoc to allow pygments args so this isn't necessary
* strip out asciidoc auto-inlined style info
* add links to helpers documentation pages in lib/default.rb
  * maybe just make nanoc a subrepo?

__Fun__

* compile-to-css tech
* create nice-looking callout graphics
  * ideally, css-only
* clean up syntax.css
